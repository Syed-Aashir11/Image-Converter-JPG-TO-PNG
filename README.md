# Image-Converter-JPG-To-PNG

Hi!

First You Have To Run The Code And Then First Click The Top Button And Then Select A JPG File.
After That Click The Second Button And Save That File Any Whear You Want To.

IT Is JPG TO PNG NOT PNG TO JPG.

My Mistake Of Wordings.

If You wanted To Do PNG TO JPG Reverse All Of The Thing.Change The Place Of JPG TO PNG And PNG TO JPG.
